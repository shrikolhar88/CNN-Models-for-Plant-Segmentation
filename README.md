# CNN-Models-for-Plant-Segmentation

In this project, three encoder-decoder based CNN models are used for segmentation of plants and plant leaves from background.

CNN Models:
1. ResUNet
2. U-Net
3. SegNet

Performance of these models is checked on two datasets 
1. Leaf Segmentation Challenge Dataset (https://www.plant-phenotyping.org/CVPPP2014-dataset)
2. Aerial Fig field dataset (https://github.com/jofuepa/fig-dataset)
